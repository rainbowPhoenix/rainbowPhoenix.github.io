For the last several years, I've had this tug in the back of my mind. "Get a website," it said. "You'll need it one day. In an age where nearly our entire visible identity is based on how we present ourselves online, how can you be complete without a website?" But it wasn't until I was filling out applications for research positions and internships when I realized how much I could really use one. A resume isn't much more than a dull summary of experiences, and when people and companies are asking for the infinite-canvas evolution of "fill this page with whatever you like," I'd have to be a idiot not to take advantage of it.

<i>But I have no content,</i> said the other niggling voice in my head, the one looking for excuses to read articles on Python 3's function annotations or play a few more Prismata matches instead of undertaking a project worth slapping my name onto. But not only was that not an excuse, it was a lie. "You've been taking creative writing classes for the past two years, every one of which had a short story final project," said the proactive, inspired voice. "And you have so many project ideas on the back burner. Who cares if they're not presentable right now? Make the process the presentation. It will do more to show them who you are than just linking to some Github repo and calling it a night.

So that's what I'm doing now. What's the aim of this site? I don't think there is one yet. It will find a focus as I do. For now, it's a place to share writing samples, or to talk about whatever project I happen to be working on at the moment, or muse about ideas. It's the modern-day hybrid of a portfolio and a journal. The least it's going to do is light a fire under me to have something to show so as to not disappoint my (likely entirely imagined) audience.
